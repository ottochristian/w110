  c.email,
  p.id as correct_profile_id
FROM coaches c
CROSS JOIN profiles p
WHERE c.email = 'ottilieotto+alpine+testcoach@gmail.com'

  ),
  first_name = COALESCE(
    coaches.first_name,
    (SELECT first_name FROM profiles WHERE email = 'ottilieotto+alpine+testcoach@gmail.com' AND role = 'coach' LIMIT 1)
  ),
  last_name = COALESCE(

    (SELECT last_name FROM profiles WHERE email = 'ottilieotto+alpine+testcoach@gmail.com' AND role = 'coach' LIMIT 1)
  )
WHERE email = 'ottilieotto+alpine+testcoach@gmail.com'
  AND (
    profile_id IS NULL 
    OR profile_id != (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'ottilieotto+alpine+testcoach@gmail.com' AND role = 'coach' LIMIT 1)
  );

-- Step 4: If no coach record exists with this email, create one
INSERT INTO coaches (profile_id, club_id, first_name, last_name, email)
SELECT
