### ❌ Missing RLS Policies

1. **programs** - No RLS policies found
   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: This table needs RLS!
   - Currently relies entirely on manual filtering

2. **sub_programs** - No RLS policies found
   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: This table needs RLS!

3. **groups** - No RLS policies found
   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: This table needs RLS!

4. **seasons** - No RLS policies found
   - Should be scoped by club

5. **clubs** - Likely doesn't need RLS (system-wide)

6. **coach_assignments** - No RLS policies found

## Recommendation

**Before removing manual filtering**, we need to:

1. ✅ Create RLS policies for `programs` table
2. ✅ Create RLS policies for `sub_programs` table  
3. ✅ Create RLS policies for `groups` table
4. ✅ Create RLS policies for `seasons` table
5. ✅ Create RLS policies for `coach_assignments` table

## Action Items

1. Create migration for missing RLS policies
2. Test that RLS properly filters data
3. Then remove manual filtering from client code
