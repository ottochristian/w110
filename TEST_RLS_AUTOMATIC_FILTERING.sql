-- Test Script: Verify RLS Automatically Filters Data by Club
-- This script tests that RLS policies properly scope data without manual club_id filtering
-- Run this as different users (admin, parent, coach) to verify access control

-- ============================================
-- TEST 1: Verify RLS is Enabled
-- ============================================

  schemaname,
  tablename,

-- TEST 2: Admin User - Should See Only Their Club's Data
-- ============================================
-- Prerequisites: 
-- 1. Log in as an admin user (get their user ID from auth.users)
-- 2. Note their club_id from profiles table
-- 3. Verify there are other clubs with data

-- Example: Test as admin with id = 'YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID'
-- Uncomment and replace with actual user ID:
/*
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claim.sub = 'YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID';

-- Test programs query (should only return admin's club programs)

-- Should see: programs_visible = only their club, clubs_visible = 1, club_ids = [their_club_id]

-- Test athletes query

-- Test coaches query
SELECT

-- TEST 3: Parent User - Should See Only Their Household's Data
-- ============================================
-- Prerequisites:
-- 1. Log in as a parent user
-- 2. Verify parent has household_guardians link

/*
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claim.sub = 'YOUR_PARENT_USER_ID';

-- Test athletes query (should only return athletes in parent's household)
SELECT

-- Test registrations query

-- ============================================
-- TEST 4: Coach User - Should See Only Assigned Programs
-- ============================================
-- Prerequisites:
-- 1. Log in as a coach user
-- 2. Verify coach has coach_assignments

/*
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claim.sub = 'YOUR_COACH_USER_ID';

-- Test programs query (should only return assigned programs)
SELECT 
  'Coach Programs Test' as test_name,
