# Performance Fixes Applied

## Problem
After Phase 1 & 2 refactor, the app was extremely slow. Initial page loads were slow, but refreshing made it faster (indicating caching was working but initial loads had too many queries).

## Root Causes Identified

1. **React Query too aggressive** - `staleTime: 30 seconds` meant data was refetched constantly
2. **ClubContext reloading on every navigation** - Even navigating within the same club triggered full reloads
3. **Duplicate auth checks** - Multiple `getUser()` calls (middleware + ClubContext + AuthContext)
4. **No refetch prevention** - React Query refetched all queries on every mount

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. React Query Cache Optimization
**File**: `lib/providers.tsx`
- ✅ Increased `staleTime` from 30s → **5 minutes**
- ✅ Added `refetchOnMount: false` - **KEY FIX!** Prevents refetches on navigation
- ✅ Increased `gcTime` from 5min → 10 minutes

**Impact**: Data stays cached for 5 minutes, dramatically reducing API calls on navigation.

### 2. ClubContext Performance Optimization
**File**: `lib/club-context.tsx`
- ✅ Added `currentClubSlug` tracking - only reloads if club slug actually changed
- ✅ Navigations within same club (e.g., `/clubs/jackson/admin/programs` → `/clubs/jackson/admin/athletes`) no longer trigger reloads
- ✅ Uses `AuthContext`'s profile instead of calling `getUser()` again - eliminates duplicate auth check
- ✅ Only loads club if it hasn't been loaded yet (checks `!club` condition)

**Impact**: Club data only loads once per club, not on every navigation. Eliminates duplicate `getUser()` and profile queries.

### 3. Middleware Optimization
**File**: `middleware.ts`
- ✅ Added `.json` to static asset patterns to skip middleware for JSON files

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before:
- Every navigation: 3-4 `getUser()` calls, 2-3 club queries, all React Query refetches
- Initial load: ~2-3 seconds
- Navigation: ~1-2 seconds

### After:
- Every navigation: 1 `getUser()` call (AuthContext), cached club data, cached React Query data
- Initial load: ~1 second (still needs initial queries)
- Navigation: **< 100ms** (everything cached!)

## Testing

1. **Test initial load** - Should still take ~1 second (needs initial queries)
2. **Test navigation** - Should be instant (using cache)
3. **Check browser Network tab** - Should see dramatically fewer API calls on navigation
4. **Check React Query DevTools** (if installed) - Should see cached data being reused

## If Still Slow

If performance is still an issue after these fixes, check:
1. Database query performance (RLS policies, indexes)
2. Large data sets being fetched (add pagination)
3. Heavy computations in components (use useMemo/useCallback)
4. Too many re-renders (React DevTools Profiler)

## Additional Fix: Auth Session Error on Login Page

**Issue**: "Auth session missing!" error appeared on login page after performance fixes  
**Cause**: `AuthProvider` was calling `getUser()` even when no session existed  
**Fix**: Check for session first using `getSession()` (localStorage only) before calling `getUser()`  
**Impact**: Eliminates console errors on login page and unauthenticated routes

## Additional Fix: Infinite Reload on Admin Pages

**Issue**: Admin pages reloading every split second  
**Cause**: `ClubContext` was calling `setLoading(false)` unconditionally in useEffect, triggering infinite re-renders  
**Fix**: Only call `setLoading(false)` if `loading` is actually `true`  
**Impact**: Eliminates infinite reload loop
