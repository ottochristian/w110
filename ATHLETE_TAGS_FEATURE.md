    status,
    payment_status,
    season_id,
    sub_program_id,
    seasons (id, name, is_current),
    sub_programs (
      id, name,
      programs (id, name)
    )
  )
`)
```

### Helper Functions

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Active, Paid Athlete
```
Tags: ✓ 2024-2025 | Alpine Skiing | ✓ paid | active
Meaning: Currently enrolled in Alpine for 2024-2025 season, payment complete
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Programs
```
Tags: ✓ 2024-2025 | Alpine Skiing | Nordic Skiing | ⏱ pending | active
Meaning: Enrolled in 2 programs, payment pending
```

### Scenario 3: Past Season Only
```
Tags: 2023-2024 | Freestyle | ✓ paid | active
Meaning: Was active last season, hasn't registered for current season yet
```

### Scenario 4: No Registrations
```
Tags: No registrations
Meaning: Athlete added but never registered for any programs
```

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization:
- Single query with joins (no N+1 problem)
- RLS automatically filters by club
- Results cached by React Query
- Registrations pre-loaded with athlete data

### Render Optimization:
- Helper functions run once per athlete
- Minimal re-renders
- Tags only show if data exists

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions:
1. **Age Group Tag**: Show current age group category
2. **Coach Assignment Tag**: Show assigned coach
3. **Group Tag**: Show specific group within sub-program
4. **Attendance Tag**: Show attendance percentage
5. **Emergency Contact Tag**: Indicator if contact info complete
6. **Filter by Tags**: Click a tag to filter athlete list
7. **Tag Tooltips**: Hover for more details
8. **Export with Tags**: Include tag data in exports

### Analytics Opportunities:
- Track most common program combinations
- Identify payment delay patterns
- Monitor season-to-season retention
- Analyze registration timing

## Migration Notes

### No Database Changes Required
This is a pure UI enhancement using existing data structure.

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing athlete queries continue to work
- Backward compatible with old athlete list format
- Service method signature unchanged (just enhanced select)

## Summary

Added rich visual tags to athlete list providing instant visibility into:
- Season enrollment (current vs. past)
- Program participation (multi-program support)
- Payment status (paid/pending/unpaid)
- Registration state (active/pending/other)

This significantly improves admin efficiency by reducing clicks needed to understand athlete status.
