## 🐛 Quick Debug Commands

FROM profiles 
WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Check data exists:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM athletes WHERE club_id = '<your_club_id>';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM programs WHERE club_id = '<your_club_id>';
```

### Check RLS is enabled:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('athletes', 'programs', 'coaches');
```
