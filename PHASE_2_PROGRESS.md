# Phase 2: Simplify Data Layer - Progress Report

## ✅ Completed

### 1. RLS Policies Created & Optimized ✅
- **Migration 39**: Programs RLS policies
- **Migration 40**: Sub-programs RLS policies (optimized to use `club_id` directly)
- **Migration 41**: Groups, Seasons, Coach Assignments RLS policies (optimized)
- **Optimizations**: Removed nested subqueries, using `club_id` directly for better performance

### 2. Test Script Created ✅
- **Created**: `TEST_RLS_AUTOMATIC_FILTERING.sql`
- Comprehensive test suite to verify RLS works correctly
- Tests for admin, parent, and coach access patterns
- Cross-club data leakage prevention tests

### 3. Service Layer Updated ✅
- **Updated**: `lib/services/programs-service.ts`
  - Removed `clubId` parameter from `getProgramsByClub()`
  - RLS now handles club filtering automatically
  - Cleaner, simpler API

### 4. React Query Hooks Updated ✅
- **Updated**: `lib/hooks/use-programs.ts`
  - Removed `clubId` parameter
  - RLS handles filtering - no manual filtering needed
  - Simpler hook signature

### 5. Base Hooks Created ✅
- **Created**: `lib/hooks/use-season.ts`
  - Base season hook for all roles
  - Handles URL params and localStorage for season selection
  - RLS handles club filtering automatically

### 6. Refactored Hooks Created ✅
- **Created**: `lib/hooks/use-admin-club-refactored.ts`
  - Uses base `useRequireAdmin()` instead of duplicate auth logic
  - Composes with `useClub()` for club context
- **Created**: `lib/hooks/use-admin-season-refactored.ts`
  - Uses base `useSeason()` hook
  - Removed duplicate season fetching logic

### 7. Programs Page Migrated ✅
- **Updated**: `app/admin/programs/page.tsx`
  - Removed `clubQuery` - RLS handles filtering
  - Uses React Query hooks (`usePrograms`)
  - Uses `useRequireAdmin()` instead of `useAdminClub()`
  - Uses standardized loading/error components
  - **Reduced from ~380 lines to ~280 lines** (100 lines removed!)

## 📊 Impact

### Code Simplification
- **Before**: `usePrograms(clubId, seasonId, includeSubPrograms)` - requires clubId
- **After**: `usePrograms(seasonId, includeSubPrograms)` - RLS handles club filtering
- **Simpler API**: One less parameter to manage

### Performance
- **Optimized RLS policies**: Direct `club_id` comparisons instead of nested subqueries
- **Better indexing**: Using indexed `club_id` columns directly

### Security
- **RLS as source of truth**: No risk of forgetting manual filtering
- **Automatic scoping**: All queries automatically filtered by club

## 🚧 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run migration 41 (groups, seasons, coach_assignments RLS)
2. Test RLS with the test script
3. Update remaining pages to remove `clubQuery`/`withClubFilter`

### Pages to Update (Remove Manual Filtering)
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Dashboard
- `app/admin/athletes/page.tsx` - Athletes list
- `app/admin/coaches/page.tsx` - Coaches list
- `app/admin/registrations/page.tsx` - Registrations
- `app/admin/reports/page.tsx` - Reports
- And 15+ more pages...

### Hook Migration
- Replace `useAdminClub` with refactored version (or use `useRequireAdmin` + `useClub` directly)
- Replace `useAdminSeason` with refactored version
- Replace `useCoachSeason` with base `useSeason` hook

## 📝 Notes

- **Refactored hooks are in separate files** (`-refactored.ts`) for now
- Can be swapped in gradually or all at once
- Old hooks still work - migration is backward compatible
- Need to test thoroughly before full migration

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ RLS policies created for all tables
- ✅ RLS policies optimized (direct club_id comparisons)
- ✅ Test script created
- ✅ Service layer updated (programs)
- ✅ React Query hooks updated
- ✅ Base hooks created
- ✅ One page fully migrated (programs)
- ⏳ Remaining pages to migrate
- ⏳ Old hooks to replace
