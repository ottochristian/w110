DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update coaches in their club" ON coaches;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete coaches in their club" ON coaches;

FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (profile_id = auth.uid());

-- Step 4: Policy to allow coaches to update their own record
CREATE POLICY "Coaches can update their own record"
ON coaches
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (profile_id = auth.uid())
WITH CHECK (profile_id = auth.uid());

-- Step 5: Policy to allow admins to view all coaches in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all coaches in their club"
ON coaches
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM profiles p
    WHERE p.id = auth.uid()
      AND p.role IN ('admin', 'system_admin')
      AND p.club_id = coaches.club_id
  )
);

-- Step 6: Policy to allow admins to insert coaches in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can insert coaches in their club"
ON coaches
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1

    WHERE p.id = auth.uid()
      AND p.role IN ('admin', 'system_admin')
      AND p.club_id = coaches.club_id
  )
);

-- Step 7: Policy to allow admins to update coaches in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update coaches in their club"
ON coaches
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM profiles p
    WHERE p.id = auth.uid()
      AND p.role IN ('admin', 'system_admin')

-- Step 8: Policy to allow admins to delete coaches in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete coaches in their club"
ON coaches
FOR DELETE
