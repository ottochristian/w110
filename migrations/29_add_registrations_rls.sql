-- Migration 29: Add RLS policies for registrations table
-- Allows parents to create/view registrations for athletes in their household
-- Allows admins to manage all registrations in their club

-- Step 1: Enable RLS if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE registrations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Drop existing policies if they exist (to recreate them)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Parents can view registrations for their athletes" ON registrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Parents can insert registrations for their athletes" ON registrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Parents can update registrations for their athletes" ON registrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all registrations in their club" ON registrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can insert registrations in their club" ON registrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update registrations in their club" ON registrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete registrations in their club" ON registrations;
