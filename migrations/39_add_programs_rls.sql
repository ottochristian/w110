-- Migration 39: Add RLS policies for programs table
-- Allows admins to manage programs in their club
-- Coaches can view programs they're assigned to (via coach_assignments)
-- Parents can view programs (for registration)

-- Step 1: Enable RLS if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE programs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Drop existing policies if they exist (to recreate them)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all programs in their club" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can insert programs in their club" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update programs in their club" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete programs in their club" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Coaches can view programs they're assigned to" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Parents can view programs in their club" ON programs;

-- Step 3: Policy to allow admins to view all programs in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all programs in their club"

-- Step 4: Policy to allow admins to insert programs in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can insert programs in their club"
ON programs
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated

-- Step 5: Policy to allow admins to update programs in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update programs in their club"

-- Step 6: Policy to allow admins to delete programs in their club
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete programs in their club"
ON programs
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated

-- Step 7: Policy to allow coaches to view programs they're assigned to
CREATE POLICY "Coaches can view programs they're assigned to"
ON programs
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1

      AND ca.group_id IS NULL
      AND ca.sub_program_id IS NULL
  )
);

-- Step 8: Policy to allow parents to view programs in their club
CREATE POLICY "Parents can view programs in their club"
ON programs
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM profiles p
