-- Fix RLS for programs, sub_programs, and groups tables
-- This will stop duplicate programs from showing up

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: Fix club_id values
-- ============================================

-- Fix programs club_id (should match their season's club)
UPDATE programs p
SET club_id = s.club_id
FROM seasons s
WHERE s.id = p.season_id
  AND p.club_id IS DISTINCT FROM s.club_id;

-- Fix sub_programs club_id (should match their program's club)
UPDATE sub_programs sp
SET club_id = p.club_id
FROM programs p
WHERE p.id = sp.program_id
  AND sp.club_id IS DISTINCT FROM p.club_id;

-- Fix groups club_id (should match their sub_program's club)
UPDATE groups g
SET club_id = sp.club_id
FROM sub_programs sp
WHERE sp.id = g.sub_program_id
  AND g.club_id IS DISTINCT FROM sp.club_id;

-- STEP 2: Enable RLS
-- ============================================
