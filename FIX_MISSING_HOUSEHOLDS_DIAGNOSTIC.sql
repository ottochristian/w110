-- This script diagnoses and fixes missing household records for parent accounts
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- table. Run migrations/38_add_households_rls.sql FIRST!

-- END OF SCRIPT
-- ============================================================================
-- After running this script:
-- 1. Check the verification summary to ensure all parents have household links
-- 2. If there are still issues, check the "REMAINING ISSUES" section
-- 3. Common causes of remaining issues:
--    - Parent profile missing club_id (needs admin to assign)
--    - Email mismatch between profile and household
--    - Database permissions/RLS issues
